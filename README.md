#### KK_GUIDMigration
**v1.5.3 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/KK_Plugins/releases/download/v96/KK_GUIDMigration.v1.5.3.zip)**<br/>
Note: Only to be used with BepisPlugins r10, earlier versions are incompatible!<br/>

Migrates information on your character cards in cases where a mod's GUID or IDs changed so you don't have to manually reselect everything. Will not attempt migration if you have the old mod but not the new.<br/>

Also attempts to fix cards saved with a blank GUID (Missing Mod []) by stripping the GUID and forcing sideloader to treat it as a hard mod. May not work 100%, so check your cards.<br/>

<details><summary>Change Log</summary>
v1.1 Added character name for blank GUID messages<br/>
v1.2 Fixed hard coded path<br/>
v1.3 Added support for stripping extended data, fix errors resulting from missing .csv<br/>
v1.4 Added support for coordinate cards (Thanks Kokaiinum), fix errors caused by wrong sideloader version<br/>
v1.4 BepisPlugins r10 support, MoreAccessories support<br/>
</details>

<details><summary>Configuration</summary>
Comes preconfigured with a whole bunch of migration info. Unless I stopped maintaining it you shouldn't need to mess with this stuff.<br/>
KK_GUIDMigration.csv is a comma separated file in the form Category,Old GUID,Old ID,New GUID,New ID.<br/>
Category is the internal one used by sideloader, not the numeric category.<br/>
When the category is * only GUID migration will be attempted and whatever you put for Old/New ID will be ignored. Use only in cases where a GUID changed and the IDs stay the same.<br/>
When the category is - the extended data will be stripped and will be treated as a hard mod

#### KK_MaterialEditor
**v1.2 - [Download](https://www.patreon.com/posts/27881027)**<br/>
MaterialEditor is a plugin that allows you to edit many properties of objects that aren't usually accessible in game. Much like [Marco's clothing overlays](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/Koikatu-Overlay-Mods) you can replace the texture of an item, however with MaterialEditor you can edit much more than clothes. Edit clothes, accessories, hair, and even Studio items.

Features:
* Export UV maps of a mesh to help with drawing textures
* Replace nearly any texture with custom textures
* Change properties of materials to control things like shininess or outline thickness
* Change properties of the mesh to affect whether it casts shadows or disable a mesh completely
* All changes save and load with the card or Studio scene
* Duplicate textures are saved to the card once. 100 accessories with the same texture have the same file size as one accessory with a texture

Access the Material Editor by pressing the "Open Material Editor" button on clothes, hair, or accessories in the character maker. Access it in Studio by pressing the "Mat. Editor" button on the Workspace with a studio item selected.

<details><summary>Change Log</summary>
v1.1 Fixed errors loading coordinates, errors loading scenes with multiple characters<br/>
